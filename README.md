# Transfer-Learning-on-RESNET50
This code is part of a Kaggle project where we had to identify whale species based on the pictures of their tails. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/data .
Keras' RESNET50 has been used as the base model on which I have added a final "Softmax" layer which does the final prediction into 5004 classes.
Keras' ImageDataGenerator has been used for Image Augmentation.
